[Nobody Speak on Netflix](https://www.netflix.com/title/80168227)

A few days ago I noticed this in the new releases section on Netflix and added it to my list. Felt like something I needed to be in the right mindset to watch. 

It's a really well done documentary and spends most of the runtime covering the Hulk Hogan v Gawker case. It includes a look at how Peter Theil used this case as a way to score in a personal vendetta against Gawker, which is pretty chilling when you combine it with his brand of elitist, Ubermensch libertarianism.

It also covers some other stories, included some crazy manipulative and disgusting behavior around a paper in Las Vegas.

Documentaries like this tend to paint a more dire picture than the reality. There are troubling signs for press freedom today, but nothing that suggests a complete lockdown. 

The press gets shit wrong, and when they are wrong it can have a negative impact on the people they cover. But, I'd much rather live in a place with a free press than one where we're only ever fed half-truth.
