5 years ago I sent a tweet asking someone at AppRiver what I needed to learn to get a job in their support department. I got a reply telling me they focused on helping customers and asked me to send them my resume. A few weeks later I signed on as a support tech. I’ve always loved tech, and working at AppRiver has been a dream gig. I’ve had a blast getting to work on a bunch of different projects, especially during my time as Services Evangelist in our marketing department.

Because I’ve built so many great friendships the last few years, and AppRiver has grown so much during that time, I wanted to take some time to let everyone know Friday will be my last day at AppRiver. Next week I’ll be joining the team at [Wildbit](http://wildbit.com/) to work on marketing their apps — [Beanstalk](http://beanstalkapp.com/), [Postmark](https://postmarkapp.com/), and [Dploy.](http://dploy.io/)

Over the last couple of weeks I’ve lived with the tension of a couple of emotions. Excitement to take on a new challenge and start off on a new adventure, coupled with a bit of sadness to be ending my time at AppRiver.

I like to avoid cliches when I write, but for some reason last night when trying to write this post I kept going back to lines from 90’s songs. Here are a few examples.

Every new beginning comes from some other beginnings end.

End of the road.

What is love, baby don’t hurt me.

Just kidding, I had to throw the Haddaway in there to see if anyone read this far.

In all seriousness, I’ll always be grateful for the generosity of everyone at AppRiver. Please keep in touch, you can find me on Facebook, Twitter or Google+.
