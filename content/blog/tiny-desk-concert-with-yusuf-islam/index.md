My wife shared this Tiny Desk Concert with me this morning. I wasn't quite expecting the gut punch "Father and Son" delivered when it showed up in Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2. The fact we watched it on Father's Day probably added a little bit to that moment too. 

Tiny Desk Concerts are always fun to watch. [Head over to NPR for a bunch of other high-quality short concerts](https://www.npr.org/event/music/368934858/yusuf-cat-stevens-tiny-desk-concert).
