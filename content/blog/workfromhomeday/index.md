Itâ€™s [#WorkFromHomeDay](https://www.workfromhomeday.org/)! Here's my story of transitioning from working in an office full-time to a full-time remote job.

The first time I realized you could work from home was 2001. My friend Tom worked from his shop doing sales and marketing consulting, and I thought it'd be amazing to be able to skip a daily commute. Then I moved to finish college, graduated and started looking for my first career gig. There were no remote job postings, so I decided to accept the need to drive to work every day.

Fast forward a few years, and I was working at my first tech company. The company was growing and had a big office. When I asked if I could work from home a couple of days per week they told me collaboration was too essential to our success and coming into the office wasn't negotiable.

I can see their side of it, video conferencing was still weird, and they'd invested a lot in creating an office. Again, I was driving 90 minutes a day back and forth between work and home. My commute was a huge drain. That was seven and a half hours I didn't get paid for and missed seeing my family.

A full workday, gone.

Every week.

I like where we live and don't want to move, so finding a remote job was the best way to stay here and take the next step in my career. Realizing a remote gig was the next step I wanted to take led me to my first remote gig at [Wildbit](https://wildbit.com). When I started, one of the things my boss encouraged me to do was find a dedicated spot for work.

That was five years ago, and today I'm happy to work at [GitLab](https://about.gitlab.com/). Everyone on our team works remotely, and [we live all over the globe](https://about.gitlab.com/company/team/). My dad taught me never to say never, so I can't say I'll never work in an office again. I feel confident saying my first choice will always be the freedom and flexibility remote work offers me.

P.S. If you're looking for a remote job, [GitLab is hiring](https://about.gitlab.com/jobs/). I'm happy to share my experience if you'd like to learn more.
