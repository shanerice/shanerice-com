Yesterday my friend Matt mentioned he wanted a simple way to share a song or album with his friends regardless of what music service they use.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">You know how there are services that let artists share a landing page with a link to their album on every possible service? I want that, but just for any time I want to share a song or album with my friends in a way they can see it regardless of what music service they listen to.</p>&mdash; Matt Stauffer (@stauffermatt) <a href="https://twitter.com/stauffermatt/status/1071427477816438784?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 8, 2018</a></blockquote>

Sometime this year, I went on a quest to find a similar tool and found Songwhip. I thought about sharing the site with him, but I hesitated. Maybe he already knew about it or was looking for something a little different. I sent him the link to see if it was what he wanted.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Yoooooooooo my dude yes! <a href="https://t.co/2ZefsuVRYl">https://t.co/2ZefsuVRYl</a></p>&mdash; Matt Stauffer (@stauffermatt) <a href="https://twitter.com/stauffermatt/status/1071430011993903105?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 8, 2018</a></blockquote>

This exchange made me think about how important it is to share what we know. Matt could've spent the time to find Songwhip on his own, or since he's a developer, he could've built a web app to do this work. By sharing what I knew, I saved him at the least the time it would've taken to search for something like Songwhip.

With so much knowledge at my fingertips, I tend to assume everyone knows the things I know or can find the info they like I did. 

And maybe they do know, or go search on their own. Do your best to add knowledge, listen when people share their experience, and you'll help the world be a little bit brighter.
