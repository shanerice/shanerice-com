One of my favorite things about this time of year is Christmas music. When I was in school I spent November and December at choir practice getting ready for a Christmas concert. So this afternoon, I spent some time shuffling through Christmas tunes and put together my 2013 Christmas mix. Here it is with the reason I included each one, and you can find the entire list on [Rdio](http://rd.io/x/QBYyLzDXVA/) and [Spotify](https://play.spotify.com/user/shanerice/playlist/4JpPTsULpYU2fRRYsHcWAE).

**Christmas Time Is Here – Vince Guaraldi Trio, A Charlie Brown Christmas**

A Charlie Brown Christmas is a classic, and was something I still look forward to watching every year. When I moved to Nashville to finish college was the first time I spent Christmas time away from my family. This song came on the radio one day while I was at work and it felt like I was at home for 3 minutes.

**The Christmas Waltz – Frank Sinatra, A Jolly Christmas from Frank Sinatra**

Frank Sinatra is the unironic and original hipster. His rendition of this song in 3/4 time stood out as the crooner classic of my shuffle today.

**Marshmallow World – Darlene Love, A Christmas Gift For You From Phil Spector**

Maybe I’ve heard this version of Marshmallow World before, but I don’t see how I could forget it if I had. Classic wall of sound Phil Spector delivers the definitive recording of this song.

**Santa Clause Is Coming To Town – The Jackson 5, Ultimate Christmas Collection**

No disrespect to the Boss, but Michael Jackson and the rest of the Jacksons own this arrangement of Santa Clause Is Coming To Town.

**O Come All Ye Faithful – Weezer, Christmas With Weezer**

A Weezer Christmas album should be a head scratcher of an album. Instead you get a set of Christmas classics wrapped up in the signature Weezer sound.

**Hark, The Herald Angels Sing – Vince Guaraldi Trio, A Charlie Brown Christmas**

My favorite Christmas hymn, delivered by the less than perfect voices of the Charlie Brown kids.

**Go Tell It On The Mountain – James Taylor, James Taylor at Christmas**

James Taylor doesn’t really spin his own version, and fools us in to believing he has stripped this down to the simplest possible arrangement. The video here is a different take than in both playlist, so if you are super into James Taylor be sure to check out both versions.

**O Holy Night – Aaron Neville, Aaron Neville’s Soulful Christmas**

One time in Nashville I almost bumped into Aaron Neville. He was coming out of the mall. When he said hello it sounded just like you imagine it would coming from Aaron Neville. I turned around and watched him climb into his Bentley.

When I heard this version, I thought of that story but listened to the whole song. It belongs on this list.

**I Heard The Bells On Christmas Day – Johnny Cash, Christmas with Johnny Cash**

First, if you’ve never read Cash by Johnny Cash stop what you are doing and order it for yourself for Christmas. It’s his autobiography and it’s a classic.

This version is different from the playlists, I grabbed this video from a late 70′s performance that included June Carter Cash.

**Back Door Santa – Clarence Carter, A Classic Soul Christmas**

I don’t have a dirty uncle, but if I did I think Clarence Carter would be his favorite singer. When this came on I just left it on for a gag, but included it because I had never heard this one and it made me smile.

**White Christmas – Otis Redding, A Classic Soul Christmas**

I’ve never seen Love Actually. Every year I mean to sit down and watch it, because my wife loves it. I’ve got a few days off coming up, so maybe I can finally watch it with her.

Otis Redding could sing me my math text book from high school and I’d want to listen. This is required Christmas listening.

**What Are You Doing New Year’s Eve? – Ella Fitzgerald,**
**Ella Wishes You A Swinging Christmas**

This New Year’s Eve song sneaks on to the list because it was included on Ella’s Christmas/Holiday album. This song made me glad I don’t have to worry about my plans for New Years any more.
